# âœ… Fixed: Test Setup Page Navigation

## Problem
After selecting Easy/Medium/Tough difficulty level, the next page (Test Setup) wouldn't load.

## Root Cause
The `TestSetup` component was expecting props (`topic`, `difficulty`, `onStartTest`, `onBack`) but was being used as a route component without those props.

## Solution
Updated `TestSetup.jsx` to work standalone:
1. âœ… Added `useParams()` to get `topicId` and `difficulty` from URL
2. âœ… Added `useNavigate()` for navigation
3. âœ… Created `handleBack()` and `handleStartTest()` functions
4. âœ… Added fallback difficulty data
5. âœ… Fixed all references to use URL params instead of props

## Files Modified
- `apps/web-frontend/src/components/certification/TestSetup.jsx`

## Changes Made
```javascript
// BEFORE (expecting props)
export const TestSetup = ({ topic, difficulty, onStartTest, onBack }) => {

// AFTER (works standalone)
export const TestSetup = () => {
  const { topicId, difficulty } = useParams();
  const navigate = useNavigate();
  // ... rest of the component
}
```
