## 🔧 If You See a Blank Page

The certification routes are registered in App.jsx. If you see a blank page:

1. **Check Browser Console** (F12) for any errors
2. **Check the Network Tab** to see if files are loading
3. **Try Hard Refresh**: Ctrl + F5

The certification pages should be working now with all the new React components I created.

## 🚀 What's Different from Before

I've added the complete certification module with:
- 8 new React pages for the certification flow
- Professional UI matching your provided designs
- Backend proctoring service with AI monitoring
- MongoDB integration for violations and certificates

- Real-time monitoring capabilities

All these files are now in your project and should be visible in the application!
