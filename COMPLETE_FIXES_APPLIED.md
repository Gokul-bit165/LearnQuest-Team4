# Complete Test Platform Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Data Calculation Issues
**Problem:** Test results showing:
- Total questions: 0
- Unanswered count: -4 (negative)
- Empty violations dashboard in admin panel

**Root Cause:** 
- Backend `get_single_attempt` endpoint returned raw data without calculations
- Collection name mismatch between runtime (`cert_attempts`) and admin (`certification_attempts`)

**Fix Applied:**
- Enhanced `services/api/src/routes/cert_tests_runtime.py` (lines 618-670):
  ```python
  # Now calculates:
  total_questions = len(questions)
  correct_answers = len([a for a in answers if a.get("passed")])
  answered_questions = len([a for a in answers if a.get("code")])
  unanswered = max(0, total_questions - answered_questions)
  wrong_answers = answered_questions - correct_answers
  duration_minutes = (finished_at - started_at).total_seconds() / 60
  ```

- Fixed collection name in `services/api/src/routes/admin/proctoring.py`:
  - Changed ALL occurrences from `certification_attempts` â†’ `cert_attempts`
  - Ensures admin panel reads from same collection as test runtime

---

### 2. âœ… Violation Detection Too Aggressive
**Problem:** When looking away for >3 seconds, 4 violation popups appear instantly

**Root Cause:** 
- `VIOLATION_THRESHOLD = 5` frames (~0.5 seconds at 10fps)
- Head pose angle thresholds too strict (25Â° yaw, 15Â° pitch)

**Fix Applied in `services/api/src/proctoring_detector.py`:**
```python
# Old values â†’ New values
HEAD_YAW_THRESHOLD = 25  â†’  30 degrees  # More horizontal head movement allowed
HEAD_PITCH_THRESHOLD = 15  â†’  20 degrees  # More vertical head movement allowed
VIOLATION_THRESHOLD = 5  â†’  30 frames    # ~3 seconds grace period (was ~0.5 sec)
```

**Result:** Users now have 3 seconds to turn back before a single violation is recorded

---

### 3. âœ… Admin Dashboard Empty
**Problem:** Exam Violations Dashboard shows no data

**Fix Applied:**
- Added comprehensive "Test Details" tab in `apps/admin-frontend/src/pages/ExamViolationsDashboard.jsx`
- New `TestDetailsView` component (lines 610-787) displays:
  - **Test Overview:** Status, final score, duration
  - **Performance Breakdown:** Total/correct/incorrect/unanswered with colored cards
  - **Test Timeline:** Start time, end time, avg time per question
  - **Proctoring Summary:** All violation counts (tab switches, face detection, multiple faces, looking away, noise)
  - **Admin Review Status:** Decision, notes, reviewer, timestamp

- Set "Test Details" as default tab (changed from "Timeline")

---

### 4. âœ… Test Results Page Enhancement
**Problem:** Only showed grade, percentage, and correct answers

**Fix Applied in `apps/web-frontend/src/pages/CodingTestResults.jsx`:**
- Added "Test Details" card (lines 292-365):
  - Test information (topic, difficulty, question count)
  - Time statistics (duration, time limit, usage percentage)
  - Score breakdown (correct, incorrect, unanswered)
  
- Added "Question-by-Question Breakdown" section (lines 367-430):
  - Status for each question (PASSED/FAILED/SKIPPED)
  - Language used
  - Expandable code viewer
  - Test case results
  - Submission timestamps

---

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Test Data Calculation Fix
1. Take a complete coding test (answer some questions)
2. Submit and finish the test
3. **Verify on Results Page:**
   - Total questions shows correct count (not 0)
   - Unanswered count is â‰¥ 0 (not negative)
   - Correct/Incorrect counts are accurate
   - Test Details card shows all information

### 2. Test Violation Detection
1. Start a test with proctoring enabled
2. Look away from camera for 2-3 seconds
3. **Verify:**
   - Only 1 violation popup appears (not 4)
   - Violation appears AFTER 3 seconds (not instantly)
4. Turn head left/right slightly
5. **Verify:**
   - No false violations for minor head movements

### 3. Test Admin Dashboard
1. Log in as admin (http://localhost:5174)
2. Navigate to "Exam Violations" section
3. **Verify:**
   - Attempt appears in list
   - "Test Details" tab is default
   - All sections populate with data:
     - Test Overview
     - Performance Breakdown
     - Test Timeline
     - Proctoring Summary
     - Admin Review Status

---

## Container Status

âœ… **API Container:** Rebuilt and restarted
- All backend fixes applied
- Proctoring detector thresholds updated
- Collection name consistency fixed

âœ… **Web Frontend:** Running
- Enhanced test results page
- Better button states

âœ… **Admin Frontend:** Running
- New Test Details tab
- Comprehensive violation dashboard

---

## Collection Structure

**Correct Collection Name:** `cert_attempts`

All endpoints now use this collection consistently:
- `POST /api/cert-tests/start` â†’ Creates attempt in `cert_attempts`
- `GET /api/cert-tests/attempts/{id}` â†’ Reads from `cert_attempts`
- `GET /api/admin/proctoring/attempts` â†’ Reads from `cert_attempts`
- `PUT /api/admin/proctoring/attempts/{id}/review` â†’ Updates `cert_attempts`

---

## What Was Fixed

| Issue | Status | Details |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Negative unanswered count | âœ… Fixed | Added `max(0, total - answered)` calculation |
| Zero total questions | âœ… Fixed | Calculate `len(questions)` from actual data |
| Empty admin dashboard | âœ… Fixed | Collection name consistency + new UI |
| Aggressive violation detection | âœ… Fixed | 30-frame threshold (3 seconds) |
| Instant 4 violation popups | âœ… Fixed | Single violation after grace period |
| Missing test details | âœ… Fixed | Comprehensive breakdown added |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Take a Test:** Create a new test attempt to generate data
2. **Verify Results:** Check that all counts are correct
3. **Check Admin Panel:** Verify data appears in Exam Violations dashboard
4. **Test Proctoring:** Confirm violations trigger appropriately (not too aggressively)

---

## Configuration Values

### Proctoring Thresholds (in `proctoring_detector.py`):
```python
HEAD_YAW_THRESHOLD = 30      # degrees (horizontal head turn)
HEAD_PITCH_THRESHOLD = 20    # degrees (vertical head tilt)
VIOLATION_THRESHOLD = 30     # frames (~3 seconds at 10fps)
```

### API Timeouts:
```python
Frontend axios: 120 seconds
Backend httpx: 120 seconds
```
