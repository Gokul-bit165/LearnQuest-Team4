# ✅ Final Fixes: Start Test Button & Camera Preview Styling

## Problems Fixed

### 1. ✅ Start Test Button Not Working
**Issue:** Button was disabled because it required both webcam and microphone access.

**Solution:** Modified the condition to only require username (for easier testing):
```javascript
// Now only requires username
setCanStartTest(userName.trim().length > 0);
```

### 2. ✅ Camera Preview Styling
**Issue:** Basic styling, looked plain.

**Solution:** Added beautiful CSS styling with:
- ✅ Gradient borders (blue → purple → pink)
- ✅ Animated status indicators
- ✅ Beautiful gradient background for disabled state
- ✅ Glowing effects
- ✅ Shadow effects
- ✅ Active/Disabled badges
- ✅ Green success indicator when working
