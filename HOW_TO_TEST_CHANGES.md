   - ‚úÖ Try tab switching during test - should be blocked
   - ‚úÖ Try Ctrl+Tab, Alt+Tab - should show error message
   - ‚úÖ Test completes and shows results
   - ‚úÖ Download certificate with your name

### Option 2: Test Admin Panel (Question Management)

1. **Start the admin frontend:**
   ```bash
   cd apps/admin-frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Navigate to certifications:**
   - Go to: http://localhost:5174 (or your port)/certification

## üìù Create a Sample JSON File

To test the file upload feature, create a JSON file:

**Create `sample_questions.json`:**
```json
[
  {
    "title": "What is Python primarily used for?",
    "options": [
      "A. Web development only",
      "B. Data science and machine learning",
      "C. Database management only",
      "D. Network security"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 1,
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "topic_name": "Python Fundamentals"
  },
  {
    "title": "Which of the following is NOT a Python data type?",
    "options": [
      "A. List",
      "B. Dictionary",
      "C. Array",
      "D. Tuple"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 2,
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "topic_name": "Python Fundamentals"
  },
  {
    "title": "What is the time complexity of accessing an element by key in a Python dictionary?",
    "options": [
      "A. O(n)",
      "B. O(log n)",
      "C. O(1)",
      "D. O(n log n)"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 2,
    "difficulty": "Medium",
    "topic_name": "DSA Basics"
  }
]
```

Save this as `python_easy.json` and upload it in the admin panel!

## üéØ Testing Checklist

### Web Frontend Testing:
- [ ] Start web frontend (`cd apps/web-frontend && npm run dev`)
- [ ] Navigate to `/certification`
- [ ] Click on a topic
- [ ] Verify navigation to difficulty selection
- [ ] Select a difficulty level
- [ ] Verify navigation to test setup
- [ ] Start test
- [ ] Try to switch tabs (Ctrl+Tab) - should be blocked
- [ ] Try right-click - should be disabled
- [ ] Complete test
- [ ] Verify certificate download works
- [ ] Verify certificate has your name

### Admin Panel Testing:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Backend Not Ready?

If backend endpoints are not implemented yet:

1. **Web Frontend will work but may show errors** when submitting test
2. **Admin Panel file upload will fail** - backend endpoints needed
3. **Certificate download will work** (frontend-only feature)

**Backend endpoints to implement:**
- `POST /api/admin/certifications/{cert_id}/upload-questions`
- `POST /api/admin/certifications/{cert_id}/randomize-questions`
- `GET /api/admin/certifications/{cert_id}/question-banks`
- `POST /api/ai/proctor`
- `POST /api/certifications/event`
- `POST /api/certifications/submit`

---

## üí° Quick Test Commands

```bash
# Test web frontend navigation
cd apps/web-frontend
npm run dev
# Then navigate to http://localhost:5173/certification

# Test admin panel enhancements
cd apps/admin-frontend
npm run dev
# Then navigate to http://localhost:5174/certifications
```

## üì∏ What You Should See

### Web Frontend:
1. **Certification Landing Page** - Beautiful landing with stats
2. **Topic Selection** - Grid of topics to choose from
3. **Difficulty Selection** - 3 cards (Easy, Medium, Tough)
4. **Test Setup** - Camera, mic, name verification
5. **Test Interface** - Fullscreen test with webcam monitoring
6. **Results Page** - Score breakdown and certificate download

### Admin Panel:
1. **Certification List** - All certifications with actions
2. **Enhanced Question Management** - File upload, banks, randomization
3. **Question Preview** - See randomized questions before saving

## üêõ Troubleshooting

**Navigation not working?**
- Make sure you're using the latest code
- Clear browser cache
- Restart dev server

**Admin panel shows old UI?**
- Check that `App.jsx` imports `CertificationQuestionsEnhanced`
- Restart admin frontend

**File upload not working?**
- Backend endpoints need to be implemented first
- Check browser console for errors
