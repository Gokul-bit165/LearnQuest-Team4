## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Template doesn't download
**Solution:** Check browser console for errors. Ensure admin panel is running on port 5174.

**Solution:** 
```bash
# Restart API container
docker compose restart api

# Check logs
docker compose logs api
```

### Issue: Can't upload template
**Solution:** 
- Verify JSON is valid (use JSONLint.com)
- Check file extension is .json
- Ensure API is running

### Issue: Test not found when starting
**Solution:**
- Verify test spec was created in admin panel
- Check cert_id and difficulty match exactly
- Use lowercase for difficulty (easy, medium, hard)

## Database Verification

To verify test completion in MongoDB:

```javascript
// Connect to MongoDB
use learnquest

// Check completed attempts
db.cert_attempts.find({ status: "completed" }).pretty()

// Should see:
{
  "_id": ObjectId("..."),
  "user_id": "...",
  "status": "completed",
  "completed_at": ISODate("2025-10-30T..."),
  ...
}
```

1. âœ… Template downloads with enhanced examples
2. âœ… Finish test completes without 404 errors
3. âœ… Success toast appears on submission
4. âœ… Database shows "completed" status
5. âœ… API logs show 200 OK for /finish endpoint
