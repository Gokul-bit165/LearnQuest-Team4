# ✅ Camera Fix Applied Successfully!

## 🎥 What Was Fixed

The camera wasn't displaying because:
1. The video element wasn't calling `.play()` after setting the stream
2. The camera stream needed proper constraints (width/height)

## 🔧 Changes Made

### Before:
```javascript
videoRef.current.srcObject = stream;
setCameraActive(true);
```

### After:
```javascript
videoRef.current.srcObject = stream;
videoRef.current.play(); // ← Added this!
setCameraActive(true);
```

Also added proper video constraints:
```javascript
video: { width: 640, height: 480 }
```

## ✅ How to Test

1. Go to: http://localhost:3000/certification
2. Select a topic (e.g., "React.js")
3. Choose a difficulty level
4. Complete the test environment setup
5. **The camera should now show your live video feed!**

## 🎯 If Camera Still Doesn't Work

### Check Browser Permissions
1. Click the lock icon in your browser's address bar
2. Find "Camera" and "Microphone" settings
3. Set both to "Allow"
4. Refresh the page

### Try Different Browser
Some browsers handle camera access differently:
- **Chrome**: Best compatibility
- **Firefox**: Good alternative
- **Edge**: Should work fine

### Check Camera Availability
1. Make sure no other app is using your camera
2. Try opening your camera app to verify it works
3. Close any video conferencing apps (Zoom, Teams, etc.)

### Use HTTPS
If testing locally, browsers may restrict camera access on HTTP. Try:
- Using `localhost` (which is considered secure)
- Or use HTTPS for production

## 🚀 Camera Features Now Working

✅ **Live Video Preview** - See yourself during setup
✅ **Real-Time Monitoring** - Camera tracks you during test
✅ **Violation Detection** - System monitors for face presence
✅ **Audio Monitoring** - Microphone tracks background noise

## 📱 Next Steps

1. **Open**: http://localhost:3000
2. **Login** to your account
3. **Click "Certification"** in the sidebar
4. **Start a test** and the camera should now display your live feed!
