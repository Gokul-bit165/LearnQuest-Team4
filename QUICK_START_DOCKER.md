## 📝 What Was Fixed

### ✅ Web Frontend (`apps/web-frontend/`)
1. **Fixed:** Navigation from certification topic selection
   - File: `DifficultySelection.jsx`
   - Now uses `useParams` and `useNavigate`
   - Properly fetches certification data

2. **Enhanced:** Tab switching prevention
   - File: `TestInterface.jsx`
   - Blocks: Ctrl+Tab, Alt+Tab, Ctrl+W, Ctrl+N, Ctrl+T
   - Disables right-click
   - Enforces fullscreen

3. **Added:** Certificate download with user name
   - File: `TestResults.jsx`
   - Professional certificate template
   - Includes user's name, score, date

### ✅ Admin Panel (`apps/admin-frontend/`)
1. **New File:** `CertificationQuestionsEnhanced.jsx`
   - File upload for JSON questions
   - Multiple file support (e.g., python_easy.json, dsa_medium.json)
   - Question randomization
   - Question preview
   - Question bank management

2. **Updated:** `App.jsx`
   - Now uses enhanced component
   - Route: `/certifications/:certId/questions`

## 📊 Sample JSON Format

Create a file `python_easy.json`:
```json
[
  {
    "title": "What is Python?",
    "options": [
      "A programming language",
      "A snake species",
      "A database",
      "A web framework"
    ],
    "correct_answer": 0,
    "difficulty": "Easy",
    "topic_name": "Python Fundamentals"
  }
]
```

GET  /api/admin/certifications/{cert_id}/question-banks
POST /api/ai/proctor
POST /api/certifications/event
POST /api/certifications/submit
```

**Location:** `services/api/src/routes/`

See `CERTIFICATION_IMPLEMENTATION.md` for full API specs.
